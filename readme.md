### Learning to Code in C
The wiki contains a compendium of notes that I made while learning to code in C. I am still learning, I will always be. However the main aim of the wiki or other materials is to be able to *write more code*. More better code! For this reason, sometimes I work on naive ideas or pet projects to just stay warmed up in writing C code. Once again, these are naive fun playful ideas 🧸

- **autodeallocate** is a library that automatically frees/deallocates all heap memory allocated using its function `alloc()`. No more `free()` or memory leak. For production code, use [Boehm collector](http://hboehm.info/gc/) or `libgc-dev`.
- **commitcount** counts the total number of commits in a GitHub project.
- **catfacts** gets you facts about cats 🐱
