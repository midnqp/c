### Learning to Code in C
The [wiki](https://github.com/midnqp/learning-to-code-in-c/wiki) contains a compendium of notes that I made while learning to code in C. I am still learning, I will always be. However the main aim of the wiki or other materials is to be able to *write more code*. More better code! For this reason, sometimes I work on naive ideas or pet projects just to stay warmed up in writing C code. Once again, these are naive fun playful ideas 🧸

- **activeforks** gets you forks of a repository, sorted by number of stars.
- **autofree** automatically frees/deallocates all heap memory allocated. No more `free()` or memory leak. For production code, use [Boehm collector](http://hboehm.info/gc/) or `libgc-dev`.
- **commitcount** counts the total number of commits in a GitHub project.
- **catfacts** gets you facts about cats 🐱
- **lib** contains interesting concise functions.
- **main** contains usage examples of all the above functions.
- [**chatnet-cli**](https://github.com/midnqp/chatnet-cli) is an experimental chat application for the terminal, that leverages a modern asynchronous multiplexing approach to stdin and stdout. (Promoted to a new repository!)
